## [Q Data Language](http://www.q-lang.io) {{ "http://www.q-lang.io" | reading_time }}

Q is a data language in development - for now, it is limited to a data definition language (DDL). Think "JSON/XML schema", but with enhancements. Q comes with a dedicated type system for defining data and a theory, called information contracts, for interoperability with programming and data exchange languages.
